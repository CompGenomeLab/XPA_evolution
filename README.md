# XPA_evolution

Evolutionary history of XPA

This repository contains three Python scripts (midpoint_rooting.py, add_lineage.py, and label_duplication_nodes.py) that were used in the analysis of phylogenetic trees for determining functional homologs of a protein. These scripts are designed to aid in tree manipulation, taxonomic lineage annotation, and the identification of duplication nodes in the tree.
